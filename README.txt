Getting Blocked When Web Crawling in Python
The biggest challenge when it comes to web crawling in Python is getting blocked. Many sites protect their access with anti-bot measures, which can identify and stop automated applications, preventing them from accessing pages.

Here are some recommendations to overcome anti-scraping technologies:

Rotate User-Agent: Keeping changing the User-Agent header in requests helps to mimic different web browsers and avoid detection as a bot. Learn how to set User-Agents in Python Requests. https://www.zenrows.com/blog/python-requests-user-agent
Run during off-peak hours: Launching the crawler during off-peak hours and incorporating delays between requests helps prevent overwhelming the site's server and triggering blocking mechanisms.
Respect robots.txt: Following the website's robots.txt directives demonstrates ethical crawling practices. Also, it helps avoid visiting restricted areas and making requests from your script suspicious. See our guide on how to read robots.txt for web scraping. https://www.zenrows.com/blog/robots-txt-web-scraping#robots-txt-web-scraping
Avoid honeytraps: Not all links are the same, and some hide traps for bots. By following them, you'll be marked as a bot. Find out more about what a honeypot is and how to avoid it. https://www.zenrows.com/blog/what-is-honeypot-trap
Yet, these tips are great for simple scenarios but will not be enough for more complex ones. Check out our complete guide on web scraping without getting blocked. https://www.zenrows.com/blog/web-scraping-without-getting-blocked
